In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply inside other routes.  If the parent routes also utilize route parameters, the nested component might not receive the correct parameters if the route structure isn't explicitly defined. This often leads to undefined parameter values or unexpected behavior.
